= Introduction =

This tutorial assumes you have "programmer" access to Open eSignForms, so you have permission to update a library, create a package, transaction template and report.

Of course, if you do not, this is also a useful guide to just read and see how it's done step-by-step.

We are going to build a simple, custom contract that allows supporting documentation to be uploaded and attached. We'll show you how to build the document through seeing it in a custom report and then moving it from Test mode to Production.

Please login now and we'll get started. It's all pretty easy.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 1: Create the document in your library http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/programmingLibraryIcon.png =

Click on *Programming->Libraries->YourLibrary* where 'YourLibrary' is the name of the library you can program in. For most initial setups, a library was created for your company using your company's name. 

== Go to your document templates ==

Click on *Documents* since we are first going to build the document. Note that our library is currently empty, but you may already have documents in your library.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/documentListEmpty.png

== Create a new document ==

Click on the *Create new* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/createNewButton.png since we are going to create a new document from scratch.

In our case, we'll call this document *Tutorial*, give it a display name of "Contract" and our short description is "Our tutorial document", then we click the *Save* button and note that the document now appears in our document list, along with our first version:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/newDocumentSaved.png

== Edit the document page ==

Click on *Page1* in the lower right hand side to edit the page. There are no fields or images defined yet, but a "FirstParty" party was automatically created for you.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/newEmptyDocument.png

== Insert initial document text ==

To get you started, just copy the following 5-line document text between the lines below and paste it into your HTML page editor:

----
${prepareDate}

${emailTo}   ${subject}

${note}

${recipientSignature}    ${recipientSignatureDate}

${attachments}
----

Click the *Save* button. Note that fields where parties can enter data are defined within `${ }` notation, so this document is made up entirely of such fields. When you click the *Save* button, all new fields are detected and then populated in the right side panel. It should look like this now:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/documentFirstSave.png

_Tip: When building a document yourself, do it line-by-line and test every step of of the way. It makes it easier to determine where a problem was introduced so it can be fixed. Also, if you know which party will enter the data in the fields you are defining, you can select that party in the *Assign new fields so party can update* drop down so when you click *Save*, all new fields will automatically be associated to that party._

== Configure the first party ==

In this tutorial, we will fill out the contract and send it to another party to read and sign. 

First, let's change the party "FirstParty" and call it "CompanyRep", then add a second party called "Customer". We'll also set which party updates which fields.

Click on *FirstParty* on the right side under "Parties to document" to bring up the party editor. Change the *EsfName* (this name must not have spaces) to "CompanyRep" and *Display name* to "Representative".  Select all fields listed in _Fields party can view_ except for the "recipientSignature" and "recipientSignatureDate" fields and click the *>>* button to move them to the *Fields party can update* column.  It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/companyRepParty.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Create a second party who will sign ==

Let's now create a second party as follows, to represent the customer who will sign our agreement. The customer will just update the recipient signature fields. 

Click on the *Add new* button, then *Add new party*
http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addNewButton.png  

Change both the *EsfName* and *Display name* to "Customer".  Select the two recipient fields from the _Fields party can view_ and click the *>>* button to move them to the *Fields party can update* column. It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerParty.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.  Next we'll update all of the fields to have the types and labels we'd like.

== Configure 'attachments' field ==

Click on *attachments* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "File upload" since we want the attachments to be a place where we can attach supporting documentation when needed. We'll also tweak the *Label to show* a bit. Note that the default label is created from the field name. It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/attachmentField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Configure 'emailTo' field ==

Click on *emailTo* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "Email address" since we want to specify the customer's email address. We need an email address to send the invitation to sign, so check the *Required* box. Change the *Width* to "20" and *Units* to "Em" so it doesn't go across the page.  We'll also tweak the *Label to show* to read "Customer email". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/emailToField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Configure 'note' field ==

Click on *note* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "HTML editor" since we want to be able to enter our contract terms here, perhaps even pasting the terms from a Word document. Some contract terms are required, so check the *Required* box. Change the *Maximum length* to "20000" so it can hold a lot of contract language should we need it.  Also check *Show border* "Top" to separate the contract terms from the customer email and subject. Set the *Number of rows to show* to "15" to give us a good sized editor window when we are filling out the contract. We don't want a label for this field, so we'll change *Label position* to "None". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/noteField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Configure 'prepareDate' field ==

Click on *prepareDate* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "Date". Change the *Units* to "Auto" since it should size "naturally" (as big as the date field is).  We set the *Initial value* to "now" (or you can use "+0") so it will show today's date. (If you hover over most fields, a tooltip will give you hints like thisone about a date's initial value.) Change the *Date selector input format* to "mm/dd/yyyy" and set the *Date display format* to a full date and day.  We then change our *Label position* to "Left", set the *Label to show* to just read "Date" and set the *Size* to "Normal". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/prepareDateField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Configure 'recipientSignature' field ==

Click on *recipientSignature* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "Signature" since we want the customer to put type their signature here. Check *Required* since we require the customer to sign. Set the *Width* to "30" and *Units* to "Em" so it has a fixed size in the document. We also *Show border* as "Bottom" to create a signature line, and add a tooltip for the customer. We change the *Label to show* to just read "Signature" with a *Size* of "Normal". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/recipientSignatureField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Configure 'recipientSignatureDate' field ==

Click on *recipientSignatureDate* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Change the *Type* from "General" to "SignatureDate" since we want the date the customer signs to appear next to the signature.  Set the *Width* to "10" and *Units* to "Em" so it has a fixed size in the document. We also *Show border* as "Bottom" to create a signature date line. We set the *Date display format* to show a full date. Change the *Label to show* to just read "Date" with a *Size* of "Normal". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/recipientSignatureDateField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

_Tip: The signature date is associated with its corresponding signature field by naming convention, adding "Date" to the name of the signature field. So in our case, "recipientSignatureDate" is linked to the field "recipientSignature"._

== Configure 'subject' field, our last one ==

Click on *subject* in the *Fields in document* list on the right side.

Set the *Width* to "20" and *Units* to "Em" so it has a fixed size in the document. Check *Required* since we'll use this subject in the email notification sent to the customer. It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/subjectField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Save your changes ==

Click the *Save* button to save all your changes and it should look like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/documentSecondSave.png

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 2: Basic Testing =

When you are creating your own document, we recommend you do this basic testing step repeatedly as you change your fields and document so that you can see the changes right away. For example, the reason we knew to change the label sizes, widths, etc. above is that when we tested, the results are not quite right and need those values to be tweaked.

== Test button ==

Click the *Test* button at the bottom left of the editor area. The *Test* button will also do a *Save* first, then show you your document in action, set to the first party defined so it shows you how the document will look at the first step.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/testCompanyRep.png

Note that the document ends at the red dotted line, and you may need to scroll to see it all.  Below the red dotted line is a *Close* button that will close the testing window, and a *View as party* drop down to let you see how the document will look for either party.

The document input fields with a yellow background are required. Note that for the CompanyRep (first party), all fields are open for input except for the signature and signature date fields.

Feel free to play with the document, including uploading an attachment, setting values, click the *Continue to review* button, etc. 

== Switch to Customer testing view ==

At the bottom of the test window, select "Customer" from the *View as party* drop down.  It should now appear like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/testCustomer.png

Note that only the customer signature field is open for editing. If you type a name and click *Continue to review* you will see the signature date and electronic signature process record automatically appear.

== Close the document editing ==

Click the *Close* button at the bottom to exit the document test view.

Then click the *Close* button on the page editor since we are happy that the document appears to be working as expected. Next, we'll create a package that holds this document for processing.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 3: Create a package http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/programmingPackageIcon.png =

Click on *Programming->Packages* and select the package template from the list so it appears in the form below. The package template has no documents or parties defined, but the permissions are set for your company or group, so we always start with a template.

== Create a new package like the template ==

We don't want to change the template, so first click the *Create new like* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/createNewLikeButton.png to create a new package like the template.

Change the *PathName* to "Tutorial", ensure the *Enabled* radio button is selected and click the *Save* button. It should look like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/packageFirstSave.png

== Add our document into the package ==

On the lower right side, under *Choose documents:* open the library where you created your document. In our case, we open the library *A/Tutorial* and it shows our *Tutorial* document. Drag *Tutorial* and drop it into the *Documents in this package* list. Note that the two parties defined in the document are pre-populated in the package.

Click *Save* and it the package should look something like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/packageSecondSave.png

== Configure the CompanyRep package party ==

Package parties are similar to document parties, but they have more configuration associated with them. This allows a document to be as simple as possible, and then tweaked in various packages to be useful in different scenarios.

Click on the *CompanyRep* party in the *Parties involved with this package of documents* list. Since this party is a user in your company, we'll make the following types of changes. First, let's change the *Landing page* to "First document" since your employees don't need to see the E-Sign Disclosures (required by law for consumers) and package list and can go straight to the first (and only, in this case) document. Check *Must be logged in* so that the person who starts the transaction is logged in. Also, check *Allow delete tran if no signatures* so that if you start a transaction using this package and decide not to send it out, you can delete the transaction entirely.  It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/companyRepPackageParty.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

_Tip: If the user starts a transaction, doesn't delete it and fails to send it one to the customer, it will appear in that user's *To Do* listing so he or she can resume from there._

== Configure the Customer package party ==

Click on the *Customer* party in the *Parties involved with this package of documents* list. Set the *Notify email address spec (${EMAIL})* to the form field that contains the customer's email address, in our case this was the "emailTo" field, so we enter "${emailTo}". If you want, you can set up automatic email renotifications if the customer does not complete it, so we'll select *Renotify* values of "1 Day" and "5 Days". It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerPackageParty.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Map report fields ==

Because we know we'll create a custom report later that can show details about our transactions, we'll go ahead and map fields in our document so that they are available for reporting later.

Click on the *Map report fields* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapReportFieldsButton.png on the lower right side. You will see an empty list:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapReportFieldsEmpty.png

=== Map 'emailTo' field ===

Click the *Map new report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapNewReportFieldButton.png in the upper right corner.

Select the *Field* "emailTo" and check *Show To Do* (so that if you start a transaction, but don't send it out, when you return via the To Do listing you will know who it was to). It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapEmailToField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

_Tip: If you have other packages already built, you may want to check the *Save value as report field* drop down list to see if an appropriate field already exists to use in reports. If not, use the "+Create new report field" value._

=== Map 'subject' field ===

Click the *Map new report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapNewReportFieldButton.png in the upper right corner again.

Select the *Field* "subject" and check *Show To Do*. It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapSubjectField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

=== Map 'recipientSignature' field ===

And finally, click the *Map new report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapNewReportFieldButton.png in the upper right corner once again.

Select the *Field* "recipientSignature". There is no need to check *Show To Do* since in this case since this field will not be set by the time it leaves the user's To Do list (it leaves when the user completes it and the customer is notified to sign). However, it will be useful to see in our reports for completed transactions. It should look like this before you click the *Ok* button:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/mapRecipientSignatureField.png

If so, click the *Ok* button to save your changes.

== Save the package ==

Click the *Save* button to save your changes to the package.  Next, we'll create a transaction template that uses this package.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 4: Create a transaction template http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/programmingTranIcon.png =

Click on *Programming->Tran templates* and select the transaction template from the list so it appears in the form below. The transaction template has no package or branding library defined, but the permissions are set for your company or group, so we always start with a template.

== Create a new transaction template like the template ==

We don't want to change the template, so first click the *Create like* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/createLikeButton.png to create a new transaction template like the template.

Change the *PathName* to "Tutorial", ensure the *Test enabled* radio button is selected, choose your "Tutorial" package for *Package to use*, choose your library for *Branding library to use*, and click the *Save* button. It should look like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/tranTemplateFirstSave.png

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 5: Run a Test transaction http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/startTransactionIcon.png =

You should now see your tutorial transaction listed under the *Start transaction* menu.

If you just click on *Tutorial*, you should see a *Start error* message like the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/startError.png

This is because a regular click starts a production transaction, and we are still testing. Instead, you want to right-click on *Tutorial* and then click *Start TEST transaction* to run a test transaction.  A Test transaction will not get mixed up with  your Production transactions, and it will also use any components (document, image, property set, drop down, etc.) that are marked at the Test level. 

_Tip: If you do not see a new popup window, most likely your browser is blocking popups, so look for such errors or warnings and then tell your browser to allow popups from your web site domain._

== Fill out test transaction document as the customer representative party ==

If your configuration was done as specified, you will see your document ready for initial input by the customer representative party (our first party) like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/testTranFirstPartyInitial.png

Enter your email address into the *Customer email* field, and enter "First test" into the *Subject field.

_Tip: We recommend you use an email address that differs from the one you login with to reduce any confusion since you will be playing both parties while testing. It's easy to create free web-based email accounts for your testing purposes, like [http://mail.google.com GMail], [http://www.hotmail.com HotMail] or [http://mail.yahoo.com Yahoo Mail].  We also recommend having at least two different browsers installed so that you can use one browser when you are acting as an Open eSignForms user, and the other browser when you are playing the other party. Fortunately, all browsers are free to install. We recommend [https://www.google.com/chrome Chrome] and [http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ Firefox], but [http://www.apple.com/safari/download/ Safari], [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie/home IE] and [http://www.opera.com/ Opera] all work well, too._

You can copy and paste the following pseudo-agreement into the editor window:

----
This non-disclosure agreement is made and entered into today by and between, MyCompany, Inc. (Company, we, our) and YourCompany, LLC (you, your). 

This agreement is entered into so that our companies can exchange information, often confidential, in order to pursue a business relationship. *This agreement is not legally binding on any parties as it is being used solely for the purpose of an Open eSignForms tutorial.*

1) You agree to keep all materials secure and confidential. You agree not to share our materials with any party who is not covered by this non-disclosure agreement.

2) You agree that the only purpose of reviewing our materials is to evaluate a business relationship.

3) You agree you will not use our materials to reverse engineer or use it as the basis for any other business purpose.

4) You agree to destroy all copies, in any format, stored on any media, whether original or transcribed, in whole or in part, once your evaluation is complete.

By signing below, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to the terms above.
----

If you want, feel free to upload a file, but this is not required for our testing.

Click the *Continue to review* button.

Assuming it looks fine, click *Submit completed document* to complete the first party step. You can close the popup window when you are done.

An email should have been sent to the email address you provided in *Customer email*.

== Customer email received ==

The actual text of your email will vary some, but the key point is that it should have been sent to the customer with a unique link that allows them to complete the contract.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerEmail.png

If you are logged in using your default browser, copy the URL from the email and paste it into the other browser so you can act as the Customer role. If you are logged in using the other browser, then you can just click on the *Click here to view and/or process this document* link in the email and it will automatically launch your default browser to that URL.

== Customer E-Sign Disclosures and Package page ==

When the customer clicks on the link, the E-Sign Disclosures and Package Listing page will be displayed first. This page is designed to give a welcome message, but most importantly, to include an E-Sign Disclosure statement, which is required by law for consumers, and is recommended for all parties outside of your company.  It also lists all documents the party is expected to complete.

The E-Sign Disclosure and Package page is defined when you set up the Package. Note that you can create your own disclosure+package pages to read however you want.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerDisclosurePage.png

Click the *Continue* button to see the contract you prepared earlier.

_Tip: Test transactions have the *TEST TRANSACTION* banner at the top to make them obviously distinct from Production transactions you'll use with your customers._

== Customer signs your custom contract ==

The customer will see the custom contract you prepared, will read it, and then will sign by typing their name into the *Signature* field at the bottom:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerSignContract.png

Click the *Continue to review* button.

== Customer reviews and submits the contract ==

The customer will see the finalized contract with the signature and electronic signature process record. The customer can click the *Go Back and Make Changes* button to make any corrections, or if all is good, the signed agreement can be submitted by clicking the *Submit signed document* button.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/customerSubmitContract.png

_Tip: The customer can use the link in the original email received at any time to return and see the signed agreement._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 6: Create a report http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/programmingReportsIcon.png =

To see the status of all of your tutorial transactions, we need to create a report. Of course, the *General tran search* function can be used to search for any transaction, it lacks the ability to show field values right from your documents.

Click on *Programming->Report templates* and select the report template from the list so it appears in the form below. The report template has no transactions associated with it and no report fields defined, but the permissions are set for your company or group, so we always start with a template.

== Create a new report template like the template ==

We don't want to change the template, so first click the *Create like* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/createLikeButton.png to create a new report template like the template.

Change the *PathName* to "Tutorial", ensure the *Enabled* radio button is selected, choose your "Tutorial" transaction template for *Tran templates*, and click the *Save* button. It should look like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/programmingReportsFirstSave.png

== Configure report fields ==

Click on the *Report fields* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldsButton.png to select which fields should be in this report, and in what order.  Initially there will be no report fields:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldEmpty.png

=== Add report field: esf_status ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "esf_status" from the *Report fields* drop down and click the *Ok* button.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldStatus.png

The esf_status built-in field is one of: In progress, Completed, Canceled, Suspended.

=== Add report field: esf_status_text ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "esf_status_text" from the *Report fields* drop down and click the *Ok* button. This last status built-in field shows the current party and document working on the transaction, until completed.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldStatusText.png

=== Add report field: esf_created_by_user ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "esf_created_by_user" from the *Report fields* drop down, set the *Output format* to "Display name with email" and click the *Ok* button. This will show the user who started the transaction.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldCreatedByUser.png

=== Add report field: esf_last_updated_timestamp ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "esf_last_updated_timestamp" from the *Report fields* drop down, set the *Date/time display format* to "MM/DD/YY HH:MM TZ" and click the *Ok* button. This will show the date and time the transaction was last updated.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldLastUpdated.png

=== Add report field: emailTo ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "emailTo" from the *Report fields* drop down, set the *Output format* to "Standard", check the *Allow search* box and click the *Ok* button. This will show the customer email address from our document, and allow you to search on it.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldEmailTo.png

=== Add report field: subject ===

Click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png.  Select "subject" from the *Report fields* drop down, set the *Output format* to "Standard", check the *Allow search* box and click the *Ok* button. This will show the subject from our document, and allow you to search on it.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldSubject.png

=== Add report field: recipientSignature ===

Finally, click on the *Add report field* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/addReportFieldButton.png on more time.  Select "recipientSignature" from the *Report fields* drop down, set the *Output format* to "Standard", check the *Allow search* box and click the *Ok* button. This will show the signature entered by our customer from our document, as well as allow you to search on it.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportFieldSignature.png

Click the *Close* button when done.

=== Save the report ===

Click the *Save* button back on the report page to save your changes.

_Tip: You can drag and drop the report fields to change the order they will appear in the report._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Step 7: Run your report http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportsIcon.png =

Select *Reports->Tutorial* to run your new report.

Click the *Test* radio button to search for Test transactions. Then click the *Find matching* button http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/findMatchingButton.png to show your transactions.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/ProgrammingTutorialWiki/reportTestTransactions.png
