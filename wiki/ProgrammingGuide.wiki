<h1>Point & Click Programming Guide</h1>
----

All customization and programming of documents, workflows and emails is done through the web-based interface. *No programmers are needed.* For those who prefer to have professional help, though, Yozons has partnered with other companies that offer professional services to handle all of your needs, or perhaps to get you started so that you can then just make new versions as necessary going forward.

The joy, power and control of Open eSignForm's Point & Click Programming is unique. Those who have outgrown the limitations of mass-marketed, one-size-fits-all alternatives will be favorably impressed by our alternative. 

Open eSignForms is based on over 10 years of developing hand-coded (in Java and JSP), custom electronic signature and electronic contracting solutions for thousands of customers across a wide range of verticals. It all started with GE Capital, then Schwab, Enterprise, Citrix, Pitney Bowes, several colleges and universities, and eventually a large number of financing companies, sales departments, HR departments, consulting and other small businesses. 

Even Yozons found it hard to keep a large group of dedicated, talented software professionals who could meet the growing demand for our custom-built solutions, and we charge $125 to $250 per hour. The only solution was to stop training yet another programmer, and instead focus on making customized solutions a do-it-yourself option, with no programming experience required.

= Programming overview http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/programmingIcon.png =

All programming is done by opening the Programming menu item, which includes links to the [#Libraries Libraries], [#Packages Packages], [#Transaction_Templates Transaction Templates] and [#Report_Templates Report Templates].

The general idea is that you create a library to hold all of your documents, images/logos, email templates, configurable properties and the like. If you have multiple independent companies or departments sharing the same system, you may want to have each work in their own libraries.

Then, once you have your documents ready, you create a package template that defines one or more documents that you want to process together. The package also specifies custom processing rules as well as defines the data fields from your documents that you allow to be included in custom reports.

Then, once your package is ready, you can create one or more transaction templates that will use the package. This gives you the opportunity to create multiple transactions using the same package, but with each specifying a distinct "branding library" that can override images/logos and property values, and each with distinct permissions.

And finally, you can build custom reports that specify which data fields to include for easy tracking, searching and control of transactions, as well as make available for download in Excel or CSV format.

= Libraries http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/librariesIcon.png =

When you click on *Programming->Libraries* from the menu, you will see a list of libraries that are available to you. 

Click on a library to view or configure it.

(_Note: To program the *contents* of a library, open the *[#Library_programming Programming->Libraries]* arrow to reveal each library you are allowed to view or program and then click on the desired library to access its components._)

There is one special library, *ESF/Library/Template*, that provides a minimal, common set of documents, logos, emails and properties for a working system "out of the box." It includes platform-specific emails, too, such as those related to password issues and the default notification to a party to access a transaction. In general, you will not make any changes to this library. 

Configuring a library is straightforward:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/libraryEdit.png

  * For an actively used library, ensure it is *Enabled*. You can mark it as *Disabled* if the library is no longer going to be used.
  * The *PathName* should identify the purpose or group that will control its contents.
  * The *Description* is a short phrase that describes the purpose of the library.
  * The *Default document style* is the style sheet that new documents you create in the library will use. This helps ensure your documents have a common look. The *ESF/Library/Template* contains a default *ESF_DefaultDocumentStyle* that can be used for a modern, fresh, easy to read look.
  * The *Comments* can be used to maintain notes regarding the library.
  * The *Permissions to access this library* are the standard List, View Details, Create, Update and Delete. Just select which groups should be allowed to do those operations. Note that this also applies to all of the components defined in the library, as they do not have independent permissions.  That is, all components in a library share the permissions defined for the library itself.

Click the *Create new empty library* to create a new, empty library. Currently, there is no "create like" for a library as we do not want to encourage putting the same documents in multiple libraries to avoid confusion.

Click the *[#Library_export_config Export config]* button to download the configuration for one or more components defined in the library as an XML file. This file is suitable to be imported in another library, whether in the same deployment or in another.

Click the *[#Library_import_config Import config]* button to upload the configuration previously exported and then select which components to add to the library.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Library export config ==

Click on the *Export config* button in a library to select which components you'd like to export (download to your computer):

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/libraryExport.png

By default, no components are automatically selected for export.

  * Select *Production only* to list only those components that are configured at the Production level.  Or select *Test version if present* to include components that may also be at the Test level, so that if you export, you will get the latest version regardless of it being at the Production or Test level.
  * Click on any number of *[#Documents Documents]* to select the documents to export, including all configured fields, parties and images.
  * Click on any number of *[#Document_styles Document styles]* to select the document styles to export.
  * Click on any number of *[#Drop_downs Drop downs]* to select the drop down lists to export.
  * Click on any number of *[#Email_templates Email templates]* to select the email templates to export.
  * Click on any number of *[#Images_and_Logos Image/logo]* to select the image files to export.
  * Click on any number of *[#Property_sets Property sets]* to select the property sets to export.

Once you have selected the items to include in the exported file, click on the *Download/export selected configuration* button to save the XML data file containing the specified configuration to your computer.

== Library import config ==

Click on the *Import config* button in a library to select a previously exported file to upload:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/libraryImportUploadFile.png

Once you have selected the file, click on the *Upload to import library configuration* button to upload the configuration from a previous export. Note that nothing is actually added to the library at this step.

You will be presented with the components that were contained in the file:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/libraryImportSelectComponents.png

By default, all components are automatically selected for import. Unselect any components you do not want to import into the library at this time.

Check the *Overwrite existing Test versions?* box to allow any existing test versions of components with the same name to be overwritten. If you uncheck this box and your library already has a Test version component of the same name, the imported version will be skipped and not loaded into your library.

Note that all components will automatically be at the Test level (nothing is imported as Production-ready). If you already have a Production component with the same name, a new Test version will be created. Use the *Overwrite existing Test versions?* checkbox to control the behavior should your library already have a Test version of the same component.

Click the *Import selected objects into library* button once you are ready to import the configuration into your library.  

= Library programming http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/programmingLibraryIcon.png =

Click on one of the libraries listed when you open the *Programming->Libraries* arrow to access the contents of that library.

You will be presented with a page that lists all of the component types available:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/programmingLibrary.png

Click on one of the following to program that type of component:

  * *[#Documents Documents]* defines all documents (forms) and package+disclosure pages. 
  * *[#Document_styles Document styles]* defines any special document styles you want to use besides the *ESF/Library/Template*'s default *ESF_DefaultDocumentStyle*.
  * *[#Drop_downs Drop downs]* define drop down lists, also known as select boxes, so your forms can allow a user to choose from a set of options. You can override drop downs in a branding library to change the values available.
  * *[#Emails Emails]* define the emails that will be sent, such as emails inviting parties to complete documents or notifications sent to others when transactions are completed, customers have signed, etc. You can define both a regular text email as well as an optional HTML-version of that email should the recipient's email client allow the display of HTML email. You can override emails in a branding library to change the contents of emails.
  * *[#Images_and_logos Images/Logos]* define the images and logos that you display in your documents. You may also define images that are document-specific in the document editor. While you may reference images from anywhere on the Web in your documents, it is not recommended as the URL for such images may change over time, or the image at that URL may change and cause layout or content issues in the future.  You can override images/logos in a branding library to use alternative images and logos.
  * *[#Property_sets Property sets]* define small data elements that you can externalize from a document, such as company name, address, contact phone, fax numbers, etc. If you externalize these values, you can just change the property sets if their values change. You can override property sets in a branding library to change such values.
  * *[#Fields Fields]* define commonly used fields in multiple documents so that you can choose them when creating a new field in a document and avoid having to reconfigure its options. It also helps keep common fields consistently named to lessen confusion (was it first_name or FirstName or Name_First?). This is not commonly used.
  * *[#Parties Parties]* define commonly used parties in multiple documents so that your party names are consistent across documents. Also, if a given party name belongs to a group of users (like "Accounting" or "Payroll"), you can specify a *To Do Group* name that associates a [SystemAdminGuide#Groups Group] of users who will be allowed to act in the party's role. You can override parties in a branding library to specify a different group of users to act as this party.
  * *Tips* just displays the programming tips page that is displayed when you first open a library for programming.
