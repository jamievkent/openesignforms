<h1>Point & Click Programming Guide</h1>
----

All customization and programming of documents, workflows and emails is done through the web-based interface. *No programmers are needed.* For those who prefer to have professional help, though, Yozons has partnered with other companies that offer professional services to handle all of your needs, or perhaps to get you started so that you can then just make new versions as necessary going forward.

The joy, power and control of Open eSignForm's Point & Click Programming is unique. Those who have outgrown the limitations of mass-marketed, one-size-fits-all alternatives will be favorably impressed by our alternative. 

Open eSignForms is based on over 10 years of developing hand-coded (in Java and JSP), custom electronic signature and electronic contracting solutions for thousands of customers across a wide range of verticals. It all started with GE Capital, then Schwab, Enterprise, Citrix, Pitney Bowes, several colleges and universities, and eventually a large number of financing companies, sales departments, HR departments, consulting and other small businesses. 

Even Yozons found it hard to keep a large group of dedicated, talented software professionals who could meet the growing demand for our custom-built solutions, and we charge $125 to $250 per hour. The only solution was to stop training yet another programmer, and instead focus on making customized solutions a do-it-yourself option, with no programming experience required.
