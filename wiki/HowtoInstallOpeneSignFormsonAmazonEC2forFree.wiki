Launch a new Amazon Linux AMI. This tutorial was created using Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03. Choose the 64-bit version.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the *Free tier eligible* instance will do. 

At this time, Micro Instances have the following specifications:

* Size: t1.micro
* ECUs: Up to 2
* vCPUs: 1
* Memory: .613 (GiB)
* Instance Storage: EBS Only
* EBS-Optimized Available: -

_For maximum security, create a new dedicated keypair for this instance and download it (preferably to a dedicated USB drive)._
