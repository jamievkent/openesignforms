= Introduction =

Thank you for using [http://open.esignforms.com Open eSignForms]^TM^ by [http://www.yozons.com Yozons]^TM^. We hope this guide will make it easy to learn how to use the various features this powerful, web-based electronic contracting software provides -- all at your fingertips through our point & click programming interface. No programmers are needed, yet you get a fully branded and customized solution! 

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Background ==
Open eSignForms is based on over 10 years of experience building thousands of custom electronic signature solutions across a wide variety of industries and company sizes, from our start in 2001 with the Fortune 1 company to myriad 1-person companies. Our target market is primarily small businesses and departments of larger corporations that have 1-500 users who need to process documents repeatedly. Very small users are certainly welcome, but there are a multitude of free services for those individuals who need to do only 5 or fewer documents per month.

Our users have streamlined their processes with sales agreements, HR and employee documents, federal and state W-4, I-9, W-9s, property rentals, school applications, financing documents, debt consolidation, non-disclosure agreements, licensing agreements, partnership documents, stockholder communications, student loans, pretty much any document you have and want to make available for rapid completion and easy searching.

== License ==
As open source software under the [http://open.esignforms.com/agpl.txt GNU Affero GPL (AGPL)], you are free to download and install and use as you see fit so long as the forms you program are made available along with our source code to your users. 

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Hosting services ==
Hosting services are available on a shared server, or a private web server using your domain name, or we can install it on your own Linux server in your data center. These all come with a commercial license and technical support services and are _only available from Yozons_ with [http://www.yozons.com/Open-eSignForms/pricing.jsp pricing shown here].

= User Guide =

This guide describes common functions performed by all users. See the [#System_Administrator_Guide System Administrator Guide] for details on setting up users and configuring the system, or the [#Point_&_Click_Programming_Guide Point & Click Programming Guide] for programming documents, packages, transactions and reports.

== Login ==
All users login on a page that is distinct for your deployment. Unlike other services, each customer or company has its own distinct web application and data base to allow for easy migration from shared hosting, to private hosting, to your own server. Also, this reduces any accidental data leaks or exposure of private data due to hacking attacks or unauthorized access that result from poor security habits of others. Sadly, large systems with millions of users become valuable targets to thieves and hackers.

Contact your system administrator if you need a new account so you can login, cannot reset your own password through the 'Forgot your password?' process, or for the web address (URL) to use for your deployment.  When a new user account is created, an email will be sent to your login email address allowing you to choose a new password, as well as set up a forgotten password question and answer.

A typical login page looks like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/loginPage.png

Your company's logo will appear at the top, along with your company name in the heading.

Enter your email address and password, then click the Login button.  A password can be as long as a 50-character pass phrase that includes letters, numbers, spaces and special characters. It is case sensitive. We recommend at least 10 characters, something you can remember, but others will find impossible to guess. 

Check the 'Remember email' box when on your own computer to avoid having to specify it ever time you login.

If you have forgotten your password, click on the *[#Forgot_your_password Forgot your password?]* link.

After you login, at the bottom of the web page, it will show when you logged in, when you previously logged, as well as the time when your browser last communicated with the server:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/loginTimeFooter.png

You may want to check the previous login time and IP address to see if any unauthorized logins to your account took place. Also, most user sessions last about 30 minutes, so if your browser has not sent anything in that amount of time, your session will terminate, you will lose any unsaved work, and you'll have to login again. Clicking on anything in the application will likely communicate with the server and keep your session active.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Forgot your password ==

If you have forgotten your password, shame on you! But assuming you set up a useful question and answer, you should be able to choose a new password automatically.

From the login page, click the *Forgot your password?* link to show this page:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/requestPasswordReset.png

Type in the email address you use to login, then click the *Send email to reset my password* button. 

Then, check your email for a unique link that is sent to you to continue with the reset process. This step prevents people who do not control your email account from even attempting to reset your password. You should receive an email like the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/forgotPasswordEmail.png

Click on the link in the email and you will be presented with the question you set up when you set your password like the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/forgotPasswordQuestion.png

Type in the answer to your question. Note that it will be displayed, so do this in private. Unlike a password, the answer is _not_ case sensitive and non-alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) are ignored. Click the *Continue* button.

Assuming you gave the correct answer, you will then be prompted to set a new password as well as a new forgotten question and answer. The previous question will be auto-filled, but you can change it or keep it, and you will have to provide the answer again regardless. This is the standard page to [#Set_my_password Set my password].

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Set my password == 

To set your password, as well as the forgotten password question and answer, you will be presented with this page:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/setMyPassword.png

Enter your password two times to ensure you have typed the expected value. The password will be masked like a regular password field and is a phrase that can be a mix of letters, numbers, spaces and special characters. It is case sensitive.

Think up a good question that the system can ask you if you ever forget your password and need to reset it and enter that in the *Question to ask you* field. Provide the corresponding answer in the *Answer you will provide to reset your password* field. Unlike a password, the answer will be displayed, so please do this in private. Answers are _not_ case sensitive and special characters are ignored. This is essentially a "second password" so make sure the question and related answer are not too easily guessed should anybody ever attempt to reset your password while they have access to your email account.

Click the *Set my password* button once you have completed the form. If successful, click on the *[#Login login now]* link displayed and you can begin to use the application.

_Note that an email will be sent to you every time your password is changed, so if you did not just change your password, it is an indication someone may be accessing your account without authorization._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Session expires == 

In order to keep your user account safe should you stop using it, or if you just close your  browser without logging off first (a no-no! -- always logoff when you are done), the application will automatically log you off if you have not had any recent activity. Clicking on most areas of the application will keep your session active, with the last server access shown at the bottom. The system administrator can set how long a user session is, but it defaults to 30 minutes.

If you click on something and see the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/sessionExpired.png

it means your session expired due to lack of recent usage. Note any changes you may have made (if they were not already saved, they will be lost) and click on the red box to continue and [#Login login again].

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Communication problem == 

It is possible that while you were logged in, your application was restarted, such as for a new release, to resolve a bug, or because of some error on the system or application code.

If you click on something and see the following (or any other red box error):

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/communicationProblem.png

it means your session was terminated unexpectedly. Note any changes you may have made (if they were not already saved, they will be lost) and click on the red box to continue and [#Login login again].

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

= System Administrator Guide =

Every deployment should have at least one user assigned to the *System/Administrator* group. The system administrator can delegate powers to other groups, including creating partner/department administrator groups who have similar capabilities, but over only a subset of all users.

The system administrator is responsible for various system-wide settings, creating new users, resetting passwords and checking system activity logs. 

See the [#User_Guide User Guide] for common user activities, or the [#Point_&_Click_Programming_Guide Point & Click Programming Guide] for programming documents, packages, transactions and reports.

== Create a user account ==
Each user who can start transactions, run reports, or process work via the To Do queue needs a user account. While you can share user accounts, we recommend you give each user his or her own login and password to aid in tracking user activity and to make it easier to handle password issues should one of the users no longer need access to the system.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Reset a user password ==
While every user can reset his or her own password using the *forgotten password* feature linked on the login page, it is possible the user has forgotten the answer to that question as well. Also, you will use this procedure when you first create a new user account so that the user can select the initial password and forgotten password question & answer.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Create a group ==
All permissions are applied to groups, which is just a simple name used to identify one or more users who perform similar jobs or work together. A user can belong to one or more groups, and it's possible to create multiple groups to support multiple companies/partners who are sharing a single system so that each such company only sees users and groups that belong to their company, while allowing the owner of the deployment to view all users and all transactions across those companies.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Deployment configuration ==

Under *System config->Deployment* you can view and modify certain deployment properties. Please do so with care. Click the *Edit* button to change values, but be certain you know what you are doing.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/deploymentProperties.png

  * Every deployment has a *Unique deployment ID*, which is displayed at the top.  
  * Note that the *ID* field is the related to the deployment properties record id as stored in the database. 
  * The *Website URL Protocol+Address* is the domain name where your application runs and is used in all links sent out. Most deployments use the 'https://' protocol to ensure secure communications between the browser and the server.
  * Ensure *Allow Production transactions* is checked if your deployment can run production transactions.
  * Ensure *Allow Test transactions* is checked if your deployment can run test transactions.
  * The *Default locale* specifies the language the application runs as. Currently, we only support US English.
  * The *Default date format* specifies how dates are displayed by default.
  * The *Default log/detailed date format* specifies how dates are displayed in various logs and other places where full dates are displayed.
  * The *Default time zone* specifies the default time zone used. This can be overridden on a per-user basis.
  * The *Default time format* specifies how times are displayed by default. Most people only show times through minutes.
  * The *Default log/detailed time format* specifies how times are displayed in various logs. For logs, you probably want to display seconds, if not milliseconds.
  * The *SMTP Server* is the IP address or host name of the SMTP server to use for sending outbound emails. Most will keep this set to 'localhost.localdomain' to use the system's SMTP server.
  * The *SMTP Port* is the TCP port number SMTP is listening on. The default is 25. For some remote SMTP servers, you may have a value like 587 or perhaps 465 if you use SSL.
  * The *SMTP Auth User* is set if your SMTP server requires AUTH protocol to send.
  * The *SMTP Auth Password* is set if your SMTP server requires AUTH protocol to send.
  * Check the *Use TLS* box if your SMTP server communicates over TLS.
  * The *IMAP Server* is the IP address or host name of the IMAP server to use for retrieving inbound emails (mostly bounces and replies to automatically created emails sent by the application). Most will keep this set to 'localhost.localdomain' to use the system's IMAP server.
  * The *IMAP Port* is the TCP port number IMAP is listening on. The default is 143.
  * The *IMAP User* is generally set to your unique database name set for your deployment. It must be a valid user account on the server which is only used to accept inbound email for your application. On a secure server, we do not recommend allowing actual user logins to this account (we set it up so it's not valid to login to this account via SSH, for example), and keep it in its own group.
  * The *IMAP Password* is the password that goes with the IMAP User login.
  * Check the *Use SSL* box if your IMAP server communicates over SSL.
  * The *Default Email FROM* is used as the FROM email address for emails not sent out on behalf of a user. We recommend the No-Reply@yourhost.com form as automated emails generally do not expect replies. Note, however, that many emails sent out will correlate a reply back to it if you view the emails through the application.
  * The *SMTP Return Path Hostname* is the hostname where emails sent out will show. For anti-spamming measures, it should generally be the actual host name where your application is running and where the IMAP server will be able to process bounces.
  * The *Start year* is the year your deployment was installed.
  * The *Installation date* is the date your deployment was installed.
  * The *Context path* is the URL path name appended to the 'Website URL Protocol+Address' to indicate your web application instance.
  * The *License* specifies whether your system is running under the open source AGPL license, in which case you must provide source code for the application as well as all programming of documents you create, or if you have a commercial license based on number of users or database size.
  * The *License size* is 0 for open source users, or specifies the maximum number of users or database size (in MB) of your license. Note that exceeding the maximum will not affect the system operation, but additional licensing fees will apply on renewal.
  * The *Default session timeout* specifies the default web application session timeout in minutes. Most use 30 minutes. It should be long enough for a typical party to process your electronic documents. If a party is processing a document and does not interact with the server in this many minutes, the session will be terminated and the party will have to restart access.
  * The *User session timeout* specifies the web application session timeout in minutes for users who have logged in. This is often used to ensure that users who login have a shorter timeout than parties who are invited to sign your documents.
  * The *Retain stats logs* specifies how many days to keep usage statistics.
  * The *Retain system start/stop logs* specifies how many days to keep system activity logs related to system starts and stops. Most will keep it for 365 days.
  * The *System config changes* specifies how many days to keep system activity logs related to configuration changes, like creating, updating or deleting documents, packages and transactions across all users. Most will keep it for 90 days.
  * The *System user activity* specifies how many days to keep system activity logs related to users logging in and out.  Most will keep it for 90 days.
  * The *Retain user security logs* specifies how many days to keep security-related log records for each user who can login.
  * The *User config* specifies how many days to keep log records regarding configuration changes, like creating, updating and deleting documents, packages and transactions, for each user.
  * The *User login/logoff* specifies how many days to keep log records regarding logins and logoffs for each user.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== Deployment Statistics ==

Under *System config->Stats* you can view statistics related to your system activity and versions.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/deploymentStats.png

Under the *System* column:
  * *Version* is the Open eSignForms application version. This is also displayed at the bottom right of the application window and you can click on the version to see the version history. http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/copyrightAndVersion.png
  * *System started* is the date+time when the application was last started.
  * *Java version* is the [http://java.sun.com Java] version used to run your application.
  * *JVM Memory* is the amount of memory assigned to Java, as well as the maximum specified it can use. If the amount used reaches the maximum, garbage collection takes place to try to reduce the amount of memory in use.  This is for all web applications.
  * *Total threads* is the number of threads Java is using. This is for all web applications.
  * *Backgrounder thread* should say 'Running' to indicate that the background task processor is running.
  * *Email out thread* should say 'Running' to indicate that the outbound email processor is running.
  * *Email in thread* should say 'Running' to indicate the the inbound email processor is running.

Under the *Web server* column:
  * *Version* is the web server version, which by default is [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat].
  * *Vaadin version* is the version of [http://www.vaadin.com Vaadin] used, which provides the user interface code for the Web 2.0 look.
  * *HTTP threads* specifies the number of HTTP (non-secure) access threads are in the web server (and how many are inactive). This is for all web applications.
  * *HTTPS threads* specifies the number of HTTPS (secure) access threads are in the web server (and how many are inactive). This is for all web applications.

Under the *Database* column:
  * *Version* is the database version, which by default is [http://www.postgresql.org PostgreSQL].
  * *Max connections* specifies the maximum number of database connections in use out of the maximum allowed.
  * *Connections* specifies the number of database connections currently in use, the number available for use, as well as the "idle" timeout for connections if they are not used.
  * *Number of transactions* specifies the number of transactions in your database.
  * *Number of users* specifies the number of user accounts in your system. If you have a commercial users license, this is important to compare with your license size.
  * *Database size* specifies the size of your database. If you have a commercial DB license, this is important to compare with your license size.
  * *Backups/logs size* this is the additional space used to store database backups and application log files.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>

== System logs ==

Most activities that take place on the system are logged. This allows for trouble shooting as well as assigning blame (yes, we know _you_ did it)! See the [#Deployment_configuration Deployment configuration] for how long these log records are kept.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/systemLogs.png

Specify the start date (or leave blank for the oldest records) and end date (or leave blank for the most recent records) and check the various types of records you want to see. If you are looking for something in particular, you can enter a value in the *Log record contains* field.  Click *Find matching* to list all matching system activity log records.

Record types:
  * *Version* records indicate new version installations and updates. Note that only version changes that require 'DbSetup' log such changes here.
  * *Start/stop* records are recorded whenever your application starts and stops.
  * *User* records show when any user logs in or out, or has an invalid password.
  * *Config* records show when any user makes a configuration change to documents, packages, transactions, reports, etc.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Navigation Table of contents]  or  [#List_of_Guides Top]</font></p>
