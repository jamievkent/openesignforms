= Background =
Open eSignForms is based on over 10 years of experience building thousands of custom electronic signature solutions across a wide variety of industries and company sizes, from our start in 2001 with the Fortune 1 company to myriad 1-person companies. Our target market is primarily small businesses and departments of larger corporations that have 1-500 users who need to process documents repeatedly. Very small users are certainly welcome, but there are a multitude of free services for those individuals who need to do only 5 or fewer documents per month.

Our users have streamlined their processes with sales agreements, HR and employee documents, federal and state W-4, I-9, W-9s, property rentals, school applications, financing documents, debt consolidation, non-disclosure agreements, licensing agreements, partnership documents, stockholder communications, student loans, pretty much any document you have and want to make available for rapid completion and easy searching.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= License (Open Source or Commercial) =
As *open source* software under the [http://open.esignforms.com/agpl.txt GNU Affero GPL (AGPL)], you are free to download and install and use as you see fit so long as the forms you program are made available along with our source code to your users. _A *commercial license* is also available for those who prefer it._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Hosting services =
Hosting services are available on a shared server, or a private web server using your domain name, or we can install it on your own Linux server in your data center. These all come with a traditional commercial license, technical support services, priority enhancements, and are _only available from Yozons_ with [http://www.yozons.com/Open-eSignForms/pricing.jsp pricing shown on the Yozons electronic signature web site].

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Production versus Test =
The concept of Production versus Test is used throughout Open eSignForms. This is a simple, but powerful, mechanism that allows you to keep Production transactions (those your business relies upon) separate from Test transactions (those you create while testing new documents, making changes, etc.).  Reports and To Do allow you to view one type or the other, but they are never mixed together.

Test and Production transactions have distinct retention values so you may decide you want to keep your test transactions around for only 7 days, but you might keep your production transactions forever, or at least for as many years as you think you'll need them.

By default, all new documents, packages and transactions are configured for testing purposes. This allows you to program the document and flow before it's put into production, and it also allows you to create the next version and test it while also allowing the original production version to be used at the same time, without mixing them up. This is allows for a straightforward version control system all within a single application.  Documents and related configuration go from Test mode, to Production mode, to the next version in Test mode, to Production mode, and so on as your documents change over time.

When running a Test transaction, it will be obvious because the page will show this alert at the top:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/testTransactionIndicator.png

Also, while not visible, the HTML document will show a Transaction Mode of "Test" in the document header:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/testTransactionMeta.png

_You do not want to use Test mode for production transactions. If you do, your customers will be confused and they will be able to successfully contest it as not legally binding._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Transaction status =
A transaction is created as an instance of a given transaction template, which itself is tied to a given package of documents, albeit with an optional branding library to control logos and properties that alter the branding that appears. 

A transaction starts off in the *In progress* state. It remains in this state as long as it is actively in use. Normally, it will enter the *Completed* state once all parties have processed all documents. It is also possible to *Cancel* a transaction so that its considered to be ended, but not successfully. Typically, a canceled transaction is done by a user who has decided that a given transaction is no longer valid, or if it fails to complete before a set auto-cancel date has arrived. Furthermore, a transaction may be *Suspended* if there's a reason to prevent further processing of the transaction, but you do not want to cancel it. You may later *Resume* a suspended transaction. While you may also *Re-activate* a canceled transaction, this is atypical as once a transaction is canceled, you usually mean for it to stay that way.

You can control the transaction status from the [UserGuide#Reports Reports] or [UserGuide#General_tran_search General tran search] functions.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Types of users: User, All Users, External Users =

In Open eSignForms, we use the term "user" to mean a user who has a login account to the application.

The term "all users" means all users who have a login to the application _*and*_ are visible to you (meaning that you can see the users in a list of users). This is important because, for example, when you run a report across "all users," it's not literally all users who have a login, unless you are the system administrator who can see all such accounts, but just across all users who you are authorized to know about. So if you create a group and put 5 users in that group, and then you create a manager group who can see "all users" in that group, the manager will see just those 5 users, no matter how many actual users there are. From the manager's perspective, that is "all users."

The term "external users" means all parties who fill out and process the documents you have, but do not have a login. These are typically your job applicants for an HR application, or your customers, clients, partners, etc. who you are doing business with and are signing your documents.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= General tips and tricks =

Always remember to click the *Save* button after you are done making any changes. If you are configuring a complex record that has popup windows, you will need to click *Ok* on those windows, then close them, and still click *Save* on the main record.

Click on an object to select it. Often, if you it again, it will unselect it.

To select multiple items when allowed, click the first item, then CTRL-click to add additional items, or CTRL-click a selected item to unselect it.  You can also click the first item, then SHIFT-click another item to select all items in the range between those two clicks.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Menu items ==
You can open any menu item feature by clicking on it, and it will replace the tab in the main part of the application screen. If you right click a menu item and bring up a context menu:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/rightClickMenuItem.png
  * *Open in a new tab* means to open this item in a new tab rather than replace the current tab with the new screen.
  * *Open in a new window* means to open this item in a new window that can be dragged about, though it is limited to the browser window and can fall behind other such windows and become invisible until you close the top window.
  * *Open in a new browser window* mean to open this item in a new browser window that is distinct from the browser window, so they can be placed side-by-side, for example, on your computer screen.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Tabular data ==
Often, data is presented as a list in table, with column headers such as:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/tableColumns.png
  * Click on a column name, such as 'Last name' in this example to sort the list by that column. Click it again to reverse the sort order.
  * Click on a column and drag it to another position to re-order the columns.
  * Click on the black right arrow in the far right side to display a list of all column names, and click on any column name to make that column disappear from the list. You can do this again to make that column appear again.
  * Put your cursor over the vertical separator bar next to a column name and drag it to change the size of a given column.

Currently, such changes are not remembered, though, so each time you run a query, the default columns and order, as well as the sort order, will return to the default.

When data is listed by name, it's generally in alphabetic order.  When listing transactions and log records, generally the order is reverse time order so the most recent is at the top.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Tooltips ==
When in doubt, if you hover your mouse over a field or label, a tooltip will appear with helpful information; for example:
http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/tooltips.png

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Arrows reveal additional related data ==
And finally, often items are listed in a tree or panel that only opens when you click on the arrow next to it's name:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/openCloseArrows.png

When the arrow points down (such as *Programming* above), that item is "opened" and any elements it contains are displayed (in this case, *Libraries* appears). When the arrow points to the right (such as *Libraries* above), that item is "closed" and any elements it contains are not displayed. If you click on the arrow multiple times, will will alternate between being open and being closed.

If there are no elements (or at least no elements you have *List* permission to) when you open an item, the arrow will change, but nothing will appear. This generally means you do not have permission to any items under it, or perhaps none have been created yet (such as for menu items *Reports*, or *Start transaction*), or if some exist, they are disabled and so do not appear in the listing.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Resizing display areas ==
For programmers and power users, we recommend your run this application with your browser maximized on a Full HD monitor/screen (1080 height) or greater.

The application has various horizontal and vertical bars that allow for fields to be resized.  Just put your cursor over them, and if it is allowed, the cursor appearance will change to indicate that you can resize the areas with a click and drag to move it left and right, or up and down. This is true for the columns listed in table headers as well as various panels on the main application window.

Popup windows can be moved by clicking on the title bar and dragging it.  Popup windows also can be resized using the handle displayed in the lower right corner.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== EsfNames and PathNames ==
*EsfName* and the related *PathName* are used throughout to name objects in Open eSignForms. An EsfName is 1-50 upper and lowercase letters, starting with a letter, having no spaces, but allowing an underbar. The names must be unique for each object type, and names are not case sensitive, so ESFNAME and EsfName and esfname would be considered duplicates. Examples of valid EsfNames are: ExampleName, example_name and Example_1.  

Some objects support a PathName, which is a series of one or more EsfNames separate by the slash character: */*  Examples of valid path names are: Simple_pathname, Company1/ExampleName, This/Is/Also/Valid.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== IDs or UIDs ==
Open eSignForms makes extensive use of standards-based, globally unique identifiers that are 16 bytes long. All records/objects are assigned such a ID and are often displayed for debugging purposes on various screens.  A typical looking UID is: {{{6dfe4d5e-7be6-425c-b083-be5223d032f0}}}. As part of the UID is randomly generated, you will not see any pattern in IDs as they are assigned. The ID is mostly used for finding the related record in the database when some issue arises that requires debugging the platform code.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== List of Records and Form Editing ==

Most records are updated using a common look and feel: a list or table of records shown at the top, with a form for viewing and editing that record below. There is an adjustable slider that appears between the list and the form, so you can adjust the space for each by putting your cursor over the bar that separates them, waiting for the cursor to change indicating it is over the split panel line, and the click and drag the line to change how much space is allocated to each.

To view or edit a record, just click on it in the list. If you click on it again, it will unselect the record and remove it from the form.

Here's an example that describes common fields you will find on most forms:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/listFormViewTip.png

In this case, note that the *Partners* group record is selected in the upper list of records and the details appear in the Form below.

All records show an *[#IDs_or_UIDs Id]* that uniquely identifies this record. There is usually a *Created* date and user that shows when the record was created, as well as a *Last updated* date and user that shows when the record was last modified.

*Enabled* records are actively used and listed. When it is *Disabled*, it is not used by the system, just as if it were deleted. We recommend you only delete records that were newly created and then you decide to abandon it. Once the record has been used in your operations, we recommend you just disable it if you no longer want it so that any references to that record can be maintained.

Most records have either an [#EsfNames_and_PathNames EsfName or a PathName] that uniquely names the record of its type. When path names are allowed, we generally recommend that you prefix the name with the company, department or group that it belongs to, such as Company1/W4 and Company2/W4 to distinguish between the W4 transaction for Company1 verses the one for Company2. Note that the path name prefix has no real distinction (it does not enforce grouping, for example) other than to help you identify it's purpose and organization. 

The *Description* field is provided for a short reminder tip about what the purpose of the record is.

The *Comments* field is provided to maintain historical or other reference information you want to maintain about the record.

The *Permissions* section generally defines access control permissions for the record itself, including List, View Details, Create/Create like, Update and Delete permissions.

Most forms also include common buttons:
  * The *Save* button will save any changes made. You must have Update permission to save changes.
  * The *Cancel* button will discard any changes made since the last Save, and will put the form into read-only mode. If you have Update permission, an Edit button will appear allowing you to re-enter edit mode so you can update it again.
  * The *Create like* button allows you to create a new record like the current record. If your record has permissions, and you are targeting the new record for a different company or department, remember to update the permissions to use the target group instead of the original groups. You must have 'Create like' permission to do this.
  * The *Delete* button allows you to delete a record you no longer want. Please delete with caution, and just disable the record when in doubt. Once you delete the record, it will not be recoverable, and any logs or other references and associations to that record will be lost.

_Remember to click *Save* after changing any configuration._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Date ranges for searches ==

There are various places where date ranges may be entered. They will include a *From date* and a *To date*:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/dateRanges.png

Leave the *From date* blank to include the oldest records. Otherwise, put in the oldest date to use for matching records.

Leave the *To date* blank to include the newest records. Otherwise, put in the most recent date to use for matching records.

You may use the calendar button to bring up a calendar where you can select a date from it.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/calendarPopup.png

Use the *<<* button to jump to the previous year. Use the *>>* button to jump to the next year.

Use the *<* button to jump to the previous month. Use the *>* button to jump to the next month.

Click on any date to select that date.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Text field searching on Reports ==

Fields that allow text field searching, such as [UserGuide#Reports Reports], are case insensitive. 

By default it will perform a 'contains' search, meaning that data matches if what you enter is anywhere in the data. So searching for {{{cat}}} would match {{{cat}}}, {{{catamaran}}}, {{{scatter}}} and {{{fatcat}}}.

Use a '`=`' prefix for exact email match. Searching for {{{=cat}}} would match {{{cat}}}, but nothing else.

Use a '`^`' prefix for a starts with match. Searching for {{{^cat}}} would match {{{cat}}} and {{{catamaran}}}, but not {{{scatter}}} or {{{fatcat}}}.

Generally, you can hover your mouse over such a field for a tips reminder. If it doesn't show these options, it is limited to only a default 'contains' search.
