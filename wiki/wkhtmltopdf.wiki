#summary Configuring wkhtmltopdf on Linux
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

These are just some quick notes on setting up *wkhtmltopdf* on our CentOS Linux servers. As we gain expertise, I'm sure we'll iron out the details a bit better.


= Details =

  * Download wkhtmltopdf-0.10.0_rc2-static-i386.tar.bz2 from [http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/ wkhtmltopdf on Google Code].

  * Unzip using bunzip2

  * Install dependencies via yum:
    yum install libXrender libXext '*fonts*'
    
    (In particular you want urw-fonts, but you probably want others too, like
xorg-x11-fonts-truetype)

  * For our HTML, we typically use options:
    wkhtmltopdf.i386 --page-size Letter --print-media-type --image-quality 100

  * For the 32-bit static builds, assuming you are on 64-bit Linux, you'll want to make sure you have these components with .386 architecture. If you have the 64-bit versions, you can use 'yum whatprovides fontconfig' to discover the component details for the 32-bit version (in this case, fontconfig-2.4.1-7.el5.i385)

= Questionable =

In our various installs, we also did yum installs of:
  * libX11-devel
  * openssl-devel
  * giflib
  * libpng
  * libjpeg

Often these did not resolve issues, but unsure if they are helpful or not.
