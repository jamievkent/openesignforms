<h1>User's Guide</h1> 
----

This guide describes common functions performed by all users. See the [SystemAdminGuide System Administrator Guide] for details on setting up users and configuring the system, or the [ProgrammingGuide Point & Click Programming Guide] for programming documents, packages, transactions and reports.

_Note that not all menu items are authorized to all users. If you do not see the item in your menu when you login, you either are not authorized, or you should contact our system administrator so that you are given permission to access that function._

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Login =
All users login on a page that is distinct for your deployment. Unlike other services, each customer or company has its own distinct web application and data base to allow for easy migration from shared hosting, to private hosting, to your own server. Also, this reduces any accidental data leaks or exposure of private data due to hacking attacks or unauthorized access that result from poor security habits of others. Sadly, large systems with millions of users become valuable targets to thieves and hackers.

Contact your system administrator if you need a new account so you can login, cannot reset your own password through the 'Forgot your password?' process, or for the web address (URL) to use for your deployment.  When a new user account is created, an email will be sent to your login email address allowing you to choose a new password, as well as set up a forgotten password question and answer.

A typical login page looks like this:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/loginPage.png

Your company's logo will appear at the top, along with your company name in the heading.

Enter your email address and password, then click the Login button.  A password can be as long as a 50-character pass phrase that includes letters, numbers, spaces and special characters. It is case sensitive. We recommend at least 10 characters, something you can remember, but others will find impossible to guess. 

Check the 'Remember email' box when on your own computer to avoid having to specify it ever time you login.

If you have forgotten your password, click on the *[#Forgot_your_password Forgot your password?]* link.

After you login, at the bottom of the web page, it will show when you logged in, when you previously logged, as well as the time when your browser last communicated with the server:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/loginTimeFooter.png

You may want to check the previous login time and IP address to see if any unauthorized logins to your account took place. Also, most user sessions last about 30 minutes, so if your browser has not sent anything in that amount of time, your session will terminate, you will lose any unsaved work, and you'll have to login again. Clicking on anything in the application will likely communicate with the server and keep your session active.

When you login, you will see a welcome screen that includes links you may be interested in, as well as how to ask questions, report bugs, etc. Many pages have useful tips right inside them.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Logoff http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/logoffIcon.png =

Whenever you are done using the application, you should logoff. This not only protects access to your account, but it also frees server resources. If you just close your browser, go to another web site (URL) or remain idle for a long period of time, the web server will eventually time out your session.

There is a logoff button on the bottom of the navigation bar on the left side column, as well as in the upper right corner.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= To Do http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/toDoIcon.png =

Click on *To Do* from the main navigation bar to shows all active transactions that are queued for you to work on.

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/toDoQueue.png

All work is shown grouped by the type of transaction. Several column headers are fixed:
  * *Party* is the party name for the current processing step of the transaction.
  * *Status* is the current transaction status.
  * *Last updated* is the last updated date-time for the transaction.
  * *Role* is the party's display name for the current processing step of the transaction.

If other columns are shown to help you understand the work To Do (such as the *Email to* and *Subject* in this example), those values are defined in the Package's *Map report fields*, in which the fields are shown in the order specified provided the *Show To Do* box is checked.

To process a transaction, just click on it. This will open a new window for you to process the transaction. Close that window when you are done.

Click the *Refresh* button to update the list, such as after processing some work or to check for new work.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Start a transaction http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/startTransactionIcon.png =

To start a transaction, open the *Start transaction* menu to list transactions you are authorized to start manually.

Click on the transaction name to start that transaction for Production mode. A new window will pop up to allow you to work on that transaction. Close that window when you are done. If the transaction allows it, you can delete it from the package's document list using the *Delete this transaction* button. The package document list is either the first page you see, or while in edit mode, you can click on the *Return to the document list*  button to show it.

If you are testing or making changes, you can run the transaction in Test mode by right-clicking on the transaction name:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/startTransactionTestModes.png

Click on *Start TEST transaction* to start the transaction in Test mode using all of the most recent test versions where available. If a component has no test version, the production version will be used.

Click on *Start TEST like Production* to start the transaction in Test mode, but using only production versions. This is a good "final test" after you migrate components from Test to Production, or when a customer says something odd is happening and you want to test out a production-level transaction, but in Test mode.

_Note, some transactions may not be started by users, and those will not be listed here. Some transactions are configured to be started by *External users*, parties who are not logged in, such as transactions that are started by your customers who visit your web site or are started via integration of existing applications you have._

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14fy5296kPE&hd=1 See our YouTube video] on starting a transaction.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

= Reports http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/reportsIcon.png =

To list reports you are allowed to run, open the Reports menu item. All reports are custom-built, but this example explains the main search criteria and capabilities.

See the [ProgrammingGuide Point & Click Programmer's Guide] for details on mapping data fields from your packages to report fields, and for building a custom report that includes such report fields.

Reports allow you to view the data stored in documents in your transactions, as well as provide basic control and monitoring of the related transactions themselves.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kQP9LK64gU&hd=1 See our YouTube video] on reports, which includes configuring them as well as running them.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Searching and filtering matching transactions ==

Below is a typical search and filtering control for reports. 

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/reportSearch.png

  * Select *Any transaction type* when you'd like to report on all transaction types defined for this report, which are listed below the "Any" entry. You may also select one or more specific transaction types to narrow the results.
  * The *Production* or *Test* radio buttons let you choose which type of transactions are you interested, those for testing, or those for production.
  * Select *Started by external parties* to find only those transactions started by external parties, those users who do not have a login and typically created the transaction by starting from your company's web site. The "external parties" option is only available if the report has authorized you to see them. You may also select *Started by any user*, if the report authorizes you to do so, to include all users (those listed below this entry). You may select *Started by me* to include transactions that you started (this is the default access). And if additional users are listed below that, you may select individual users. Multiple selections are allowed.
  * Enter a unique transaction id in the *Tran id only search* field to search for a particular transaction. This mode skips all other search criteria, but of course the transaction found must be one of the types listed for the report.
  * Enter an email address, or partial email address, in the *Party email* field to limit records to those transactions in which one of the parties is associated with a matching email address.
  * Check *In progress* to include transactions that are currently in progress.
  * Check *Completed* to include transactions that have been completed.
  * Check *Suspended* to include transactions that have been suspended. A suspended transaction cannot be processed further until re-activated.
  * Check *Only stalled* to limit the report to transactions that have stalled; that is, transactions that are in progress, but have no active party.
  * Choose the which date associated with the transactions to use: *Started* means the date the transaction was started; *Last updated* means the date the transaction was last changed or in use by a party; *Will cancel* means the date the transaction is set to automatically cancel itself if it does not complete before; and *Will expire* means the date the transaction will expire and be removed from the data base.
  * For *In date range* choose from one of the options: *Today* will show matching transactions for the current date; *Yesterday* will show matching transactions from yesterday; *Last 7 days* will show matching transactions for the last 7 days; *Last 30 days* will show matching transactions for the last 30 days; *Last 90 days* will show matching transactions for the last 90 days; *Last 365 days* will show matching transactions for the last 365 days; or *Date range* will let you choose your own date range starting from the *From date* through the *To date* fields.

In this example, the custom report also allows for two fields to be searched in addition to the standard search fields:
  * *Last status* allows you to search on the last status field, which is typically a document and/or party name.
  * *Last name* allows you to search on the last name field presumably defined in the documents defined for the transaction types listed.

Click the *Find matching* button to generate the report based on matching transactions. The list of matching transactions will appear below.

Assuming at least one matching transaction was found, and you have permission, two additional buttons appear. Click *Export to Excel* to copy the data listed in your report into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  Click *Download CSV* to copy the data listed in your report into a standard Comma-Separated-Value text file, most of which are also easily imported in a spreadsheet, which can then be used to upload that data into other systems. Note that you can re-arrange the fields, or hide some, and they will then appear in the same way in your Excel or CSV files.

Click on any transaction row to bring up details and additional controls regarding the transaction. Again, many of these capabilities are configured in the report template to be limited to only authorized users.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

=== Text field searching tip ===

Fields that allow text field searching are case insensitive. 

By default it will perform a 'contains' search, meaning that data matches if what you enter is anywhere in the data. So searching for {{{cat}}} would match {{{cat}}}, {{{catamaran}}}, {{{scatter}}} and {{{fatcat}}}.

Use a '`=`' prefix for exact email match. Searching for {{{=cat}}} would match {{{cat}}}, but nothing else.

Use a '`^`' prefix for a starts with match. Searching for {{{^cat}}} would match {{{cat}}} and {{{catamaran}}}, but not {{{scatter}}} or {{{fatcat}}}.

Generally, you can hover your mouse over such a field for a tips reminder. If it doesn't show these options, it is limited to only a default 'contains' search.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Report transaction details ==

Below is a typical detail screen for a transaction:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/reportTranDetail.png

  * The upper left field will either be *Test Transaction* if it's a test transaction, or *Production Transaction* if it's a production transaction. Under it is the transaction template name, or type.
  * The *Package* field shows the name of the package defined for the transaction template.
  * The *Brand library* field shows the name of the branding library defined for the transaction template.
  * The *Id* field show the transaction id. It is also shown in the window's title bar.
  * The *Status* field specifies if the transaction is in progress, completed, canceled, or suspended.
  * The *Expires* field shows the date, if any, this transaction is set to expire and be deleted.
  * The *Auto-cancels* field shows the date, if any, this transaction is set to cancel itself if it's not completed by then.
  * The *Stalled* field shows the date the transaction stalled; that is, when it was detected that the transaction is still in progress, but there are no active parties to move it along.
  * The *Started* field shows the date and time the transaction was started.
  * The *Started by* field shows the user, if any, who started the transaction.
  * The *Last updated* field shows the date and time the transaction was last updated.
  * The *Last updated by* field shows the user, if any, who last updated the transaction.

The *Download transaction data* button will download, as XML data, all of the data fields stored in the transaction. Typically, this is all related parameters that were posted at the time the transaction was created.

The *Reason/note to log* field can be populated and then click the *Change status / Add log record* button next to it to choose from the action type to take: *Add reason/note to log (no status change)* is used to simply add a comment to the log for this transaction; *Cancel transaction* will cancel the transaction if it's currently in progress; *Suspend transaction* will suspend the transaction if it's currently in progress; *Cancel suspended transaction* will cancel the currently suspended transaction; *Resume suspended transaction* will re-activate the suspended transaction so it's in progress again; *Re-activate canceled transaction* will re-activate a canceled transaction so it's in progress again.

The *View activity log* button will popup an activity log ([#Report_transaction_activity_log see below for more]) that shows all actions taken with respect to the transaction, as well as any user-defined log records.

The *View email* button will popup a window that lists all emails sent related to this transaction, as well as any correlated replies or bounces. See [SystemAdminGuide#View_user_email the view user email information in the system administrator guide for any details.]

The Party List shows each party to the transaction, including the status, number of documents, email address (if known), user who process as this party (if any), when the party was created, and a *More* button related to emails. If you click the *More* button, there will be an option to *View email* to see the emails for this party, and *Send email again* to send the email invitation associated with the party again, and if the party is still active, you can enter a *New email address* to transfer the party to a new email address should the original email address have been incorrect or you learned another person needs to process it.

The Document List shows each document by name and ID, whether the document was a Production or Test version, and the status of each party with respect to that document, including the party status, document status, last updated date and when the document and data snapshot was taken. The *Download document data* button can be used to download the data currently stored in the document in XML format. If a snapshot exists, a *View/download snapshot* button appears and you can click to choose to *View document snapshot* to see the document at the time that party completed/signed it; *View document snapshot as PDF* to view that same document as a PDF file; *View data snapshot* to view the XML data in the document at the time the party completed it; and *Download Snapshot XML* to download the full snapshot and digitally signed data and document.

Lastly, there's an option to select one or more documents (either the latest version or the version after a particular party completed it) and download them together as a PDF file. Just select which documents are of interest, then click the *Download selected as PDF* button.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Report transaction activity log == 

You can use the report's transaction activity log to follow every step the transaction has taken:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/reportTranActivityLog.png

Select the *From date* and *To date* to narrow the range, or leave both blank to include the oldest through the newest records.  Check *General* to include general log records, those that relate to the basic process flow. Check *Basic trace* to include more details about the processing steps. And check *Detail trace* to include the most details about the processing steps.  The latter two are particularly important when programming test transactions to determine what may be wrong with your configuration.  You may also search for a particular string in the *Log record contains* field. Click the *Find matching* button to list all matching log records related to the transaction.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== Example of transaction data in XML format ==

If you download the data associated with a transaction, you will receive something like the following, which includes all parameters for initial values and related information about how the transaction was started. Basically, most are interested in the set of {{{<nameValue>}}} elements listed under the {{{<nameValues>}}} element of the {{{<esfRecord}}} root element.

= General tran search http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/generalTranSearchIcon.png =

The general transaction search feature is very similar to [#Reports Reports], except that is has fixed fields in the listing instead of custom field selections. This feature provides full access to the transaction and thus has less control than with custom reports. It is recommended this feature only be given to system administrators or other power users who have full control over the transactions they can list. 

This view provide basic control and monitoring of transactions that a user has List permission to view.

<p align="right"><font size="1">[#Table_of_contents Table of contents]</font></p>

== General tran searching and filtering ==

Below is a typical search and filtering control for general transaction search. 

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/generalTranSearch.png

  * Select one or more transaction types you'd like to list (only those transactions you are allowed to List are shown).
  * Choose your date range starting from the *From date* through the *To date* fields.  
  * Enter a unique transaction id in the *Tran id only search* field to search for a particular transaction. This mode skips all other search criteria, but of course the transaction found must be one of the types allowed.
  * Enter an email address, or partial email address, in the *Party email* field to limit records to those transactions in which one of the parties is associated with a matching email address.
  * The *Production* or *Test* radio buttons let you choose which type of transactions are you interested, those for testing, or those for production.
  * Check *In progress* to include transactions that are currently in progress.
  * Check *Completed* to include transactions that have been completed.
  * Check *Suspended* to include transactions that have been suspended. A suspended transaction cannot be processed further until re-activated.
  * Check *Only stalled* to limit the report to transactions that have stalled; that is, transactions that are in progress, but have no active party.

Click the *Find matching* button to generate the listing based on matching transactions. The list of matching transactions will appear below.

Click on any transaction row to bring up details and additional controls regarding the transaction. This is the same function as for [#Report_transaction_details report transaction details] shown above, except all buttons are enabled to provide full access to the transaction.

= Forgot your password http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/forgotPasswordLink.png =

If you have forgotten your password, shame on you! But assuming you set up a useful question and answer, you should be able to choose a new password automatically.

From the login page, click the *Forgot your password?* link to show this page:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/requestPasswordReset.png

Type in the email address you use to login, then click the *Send email to reset my password* button. 

Then, check your email for a unique link that is sent to you to continue with the reset process. This step prevents people who do not control your email account from even attempting to reset your password. You should receive an email like the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/forgotPasswordEmail.png

Click on the link in the email and you will be presented with the question you set up when you set your password like the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/forgotPasswordQuestion.png

Type in the answer to your question. Note that it will be displayed, so do this in private. Unlike a password, the answer is _not_ case sensitive and non-alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) are ignored. Click the *Continue* button.

Assuming you gave the correct answer, you will then be prompted to set a new password as well as a new forgotten question and answer. The previous question will be auto-filled, but you can change it or keep it, and you will have to provide the answer again regardless. This is the standard page to [#Set_my_password Set my password].

= Set my password =

To set your password, as well as the forgotten password question and answer, you will be presented with this page:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/setMyPassword.png

Enter your password two times to ensure you have typed the expected value. The password will be masked like a regular password field and is a phrase that can be a mix of letters, numbers, spaces and special characters. It is case sensitive.

Think up a good question that the system can ask you if you ever forget your password and need to reset it and enter that in the *Question to ask you* field. Provide the corresponding answer in the *Answer you will provide to reset your password* field. Unlike a password, the answer will be displayed, so please do this in private. Answers are _not_ case sensitive and special characters are ignored. This is essentially a "second password" so make sure the question and related answer are not too easily guessed should anybody ever attempt to reset your password while they have access to your email account.

Click the *Set my password* button once you have completed the form. If successful, click on the *[#Login login now]* link displayed and you can begin to use the application.

_Note that an email will be sent to you every time your password is changed, so if you did not just change your password, it is an indication someone may be accessing your account without authorization._

= Session expiration =

In order to keep your user account safe should you stop using it, or if you just close your  browser without logging off first (a no-no! -- always logoff when you are done), the application will automatically log you off if you have not had any recent activity. Clicking on most areas of the application will keep your session active, with the last server access shown at the bottom. The system administrator can set how long a user session is, but it defaults to 30 minutes.

If you click on something and see the following:

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/sessionExpired.png

it means your session expired due to lack of recent usage. Note any changes you may have made (if they were not already saved, they will be lost) and click on the red box to continue and [#Login login again].

= Communication problem =

It is possible that while you were logged in, your application was restarted, such as for a new release, to resolve a bug, or because of some error on the system or application code.

If you click on something and see the following (or any other red box error):

http://open.esignforms.com/images/HowToGuidesWiki/communicationProblem.png

it means your session was terminated unexpectedly. Note any changes you may have made (if they were not already saved, they will be lost) and click on the red box to continue and [#Login login again].
